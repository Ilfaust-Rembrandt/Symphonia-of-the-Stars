The world had gone through 5 cycles; 

The First Cycle, otherwise known as The Age of Blasphemy was the longest of the cycles, the only cycle that spanned one million years, here we begin the cycle with the creation of the world itself and the birth of the first Great Old ones, the first star, Primaris.
