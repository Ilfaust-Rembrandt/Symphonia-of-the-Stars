## Overview

The **Sagittarius Pathway** is about hunting a certain target until it's end, whether it is a concept, living being, or even god himself. They specialize in tracking, invisibility, and archery. They are also proficient in cavalry combat and strategies.

At high Sequences, they can borrow from the powers of their sister constellations, such as [[Pathway of the Hunter, Orion Constellation|Orion]], [[Pathway of the Virgin, Virgo Constellation|Virgo]], and [[Pathway of the Maiden, Libra Constellation|Libra]], to enhance their hunts. They are also able to hunt stronger concepts such as time itself or kill ideas from the human mind.

The Starbounds of this pathway is able to branch their pathway starting at sequence 4.
